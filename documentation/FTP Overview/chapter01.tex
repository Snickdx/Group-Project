\chapter{Introduction}
The File Transfer Protocol, hereafter referred to as FTP, is used to
facilitate the transfer of files between computers over a network. It also
allows for the transfer files between FTP servers.
FTP is implemented using a client-server architecture with distinct control
and data connections between the client and the server. This report provides an
overview of an implementation of FTP. A subset of the commands within the protocol
will be defined and examined. This overview also covers the benefits and drawbacks
of the protocol.


%%=========================================
\section{Background}
User groups and organizations rely on FTP to send files directly between computers on a network,
bypassing the need to use physical media such as flash memory or optical discs to transfer said files.
As such, a FTP client/server pair allows a user to carry out file operations with minimal knowledge of the implementation.

\section{Objectives}
The main objectives of this Computer Networks project are to
\begin{enumerate}
\item Provide an overview of FTP
\item Implement an FTP Client and Server
\item Facilitate authentication
\item Provide the user with a file explorer
\item Facilitate the upload and download of files
\item Manipulate files on a server
\item Provide functionality to allow a user to mirror folders
\end{enumerate}

All objectives shall be stated such that we, after having read the thesis, can see whether or not you have met the objective. ``To become familiar with \ldots'' is therefore not a suitable objective.

%%=========================================
\section{Limitations}
In this section you describe the limitations of your study. These may be related to the study object (physical limitations, operational limitations), to the thoroughness of the analysis, and so on.
%%=========================================
\section{Approach}
Here you should describe the (scientific) approach that you will use to solve the problem and meet your objectives. You should specify the approach for each objective.

If there are any ethical problems related to your approach, these should be highlighted and discussed.
%%=========================================
\section{Structure of the Report}
The rest of the report is structured as follows. Chapter 2 gives an introduction to \ldots

\begin{remark}
Notice that chapter and section headings shall be written in lowercase, but that all main words should start with a capital letter.
\end{remark}


The report should be no longer than \underline{60 pages} in this format (+ the CV).
