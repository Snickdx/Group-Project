\chapter{Technical Analysis}
The FTP server has been implemented in Scala. Scala is an objected oriented, functional programming language. It has interoperability with Java as it runs on the Java Virtual Machine.
This means that Java and Scala classes can be mixed in the same project and can refer to each other. Scala was chosen as it allows for easy pattern matching in order to determine
which FTP command is being received. The use of Scala also demonstrates that the implementation of an FTP Server and Client is irrelevant as long as the protocol is followed.
The FTP Client was written in Java. The FTP commands that were implemented will be explored.
